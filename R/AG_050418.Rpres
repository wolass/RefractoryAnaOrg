Description
========================================================

- New data base is not yet incorporated in this analysis
- we may see more cases with the new database


Definition of refractory anaphylaxis
========================================================

**Theory - ideal definition:**

- at least two doses of adrenaline (of at least 300 Âµg)
- without "adequate" clinical response

**Reality - what we can use from the register:**

- at least two doses of adrenaline (dose not availible)
- AND:
  - death
  - severe reaction that required hospitalisation

**Even now we are uncertain that all were refractory**

How many patients with adrenalin doses?
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
require(magrittr)
load("../analysis/data/derived_data/export.R")
# load("analysis/data/derived_data/export.R")

export$adrenalinNumber %>% knitr::kable(col.names = c("count"))
```


How severe  (in Ring and Messmer) were the cases where repeated adrenalin was needed
=============================

```{r}
export$severityTab %>% knitr::kable()
```


Fatalities in the cases of repeated adrenalin
=========================

```{r}
export$refractoryDeathTab %>% knitr::kable()
```

First part of the definition death and two doses of adrenalin.


Which drugs were given as a "second line treatment" in repeated cases of refractory anaphylaxis?
=======================
```{r}
export$drugsRefractory2ndLine %>% knitr::kable()
```

How many drugs were given in these cases?
===================

```{r}
export$Tab2Line %>% t %>% knitr::kable()
```

And if we only restrict these to grade IV cases?
============================

top: number of emergency drugs

left: number of adrenalin doses

```{r}
export$gradeIV2drugs %>% t %>% knitr::kable()
```


Were these patients addmitted to the hospital?
===========================

```{r}
export$hospitalTab %>% t %>% knitr::kable()
```

Second part of the definition: hospital addmission. Some patients that reacted severly and were admitted to the hospital AND recievied 2 and more doses of Adrenalin - had in fact  correct response to adrenalin.
These cases can not be identified using the data from our register.


Result: Age and elicitor description of these refractory cases
==============================

```{r}
table(export$casesBrown$d_elicitor_gr5,export$casesBrown$d_age_gr5b) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Conclusion
============

- Definition is just a hint that these cases could be refractory
- manual verification of ceach case would be necessary
- We know nothing about the sensitivity of this definition
- Further analysis according to cofactors, symptoms and detailed triggers follows.

```{r}
require(ggplot2)

ggplot(export$casesBrown,aes(x=d_elicitor_gr5))+
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")+
  facet_grid(.~d_age_gr2)+
  theme_classic()+
  xlab("Elicitors")
```
